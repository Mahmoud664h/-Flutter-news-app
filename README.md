Overview: The project is a Flutter-based news application that leverages a news API to provide real-time updates and display a variety of news articles. It pulls news data from an external source, categorizes it, and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can browse news articles, read summaries, and even click on links to read full articles in their browser.
